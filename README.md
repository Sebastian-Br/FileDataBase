# FileDataBase
Just a showcase project showing that serializing objects from memory to the file system is not a practical idea at all, even if it might sound neat. The project is not intended to have any use-case besides that. The crux is that renaming properties will eventually result in errors or, even worse, lead the database to confuse two properties.
